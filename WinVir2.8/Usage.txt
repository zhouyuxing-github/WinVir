#######################       Hey~~ Attention       ##########################
The path of winVir must be in english with no space and illegal characters ! 
Such as "/d/bio_software/winVir" is correct; "/d/bio  software/winVir" is incorrect!!

Please be note that you have to download Gitbash first to provide the necessary environment.
Download  Gitbash ==> (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Usage:
1. START a Gitbash command window. 
2. DRAG "WinVir.bash" script into Gitbash command window, type " -i ", drag metavirome rawdata (fastq.gz format) into the command window, then press enter to run.

for example:
/c/Users/DELL/Desktop/winVir/reads_blast.bash  -i  /d/test/F15_FDME21019_1.fq.gz
(If the data is pair-ended, only one need to be analyzed. When the cursor is on the bottom left of the window, the program is running...)


If you want to update or make a database by yourself, please remove everything in the "databases" folder, then put your new fasta (with gene ID) dataset in.
